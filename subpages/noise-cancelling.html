                    <h2 class="article-subtitle">How it works</h2>
                    <div class="article-text">
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            Noise-cancelling can actually be of two types – passive or active noise cancelling.</div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            Passive noise-cancelling consists of blocking the sound using sound-proofing materials such as high-density foam. The outcome of using this kind of materials is that the headphones are able to block some high-frequency levels.</div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            Although, this can be really useful, a lot of the outside noise still passes through. In this case, active noise-cancelling comes into play. This technology provides reduction not only of high frequency sound waves, but also low frequency. By covering more of the sound spectrum, the user is left with a more quiet and enjoyable experience of the sounds they actually want to hear.</div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            In order to block these sound waves, the headphones are equipped with a microphone which registers the sounds, the circuitry which receives the sound waves and then produces a negative sound wave to the first one, cancelling the noise, the speaker used in order to produce that sound and a battery for powering the system which makes all of this happen.</div>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class="article-subtitle">The history</h2>
                    <div class="article-text">
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            It is said that the first noise-cancellation headphones were created by Dr. Lawrence Jerome Fogel in the 1950’s for the aviation field. Especially for cockpit pilots who have to deal with harmful sounds during their flights.</div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            Considering the consumer market, Bose was the first company to introduce noise-cancelling headphones for the public with the QuietComfort series in 2000.</div>

                        Best for</h2>
                    <div class="article-text">
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            There are actually more ways in which noise-cancelling headphones can be used than one person expects usually. Some of those include being able to listen to music or podcasts while traveling (airplanes, trains, buses etc.), in any loud environments, sleeping aids or in aviation so that the pilot can communicate easier and also that their hearing is protected.</div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            Besides all of this listed earlier, this kind of headphones can be used simply to block the sound, if you want to just relax, without having to listen to anything.
